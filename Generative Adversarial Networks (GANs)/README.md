# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Anime Face Generation

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic anime face images. GANs are a powerful class of deep learning models that consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator network learns to create realistic fake data, while the discriminator network aims to distinguish between real and fake data. Through this adversarial training process, the generator gradually improves its ability to generate high-quality, realistic data.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [Anime Face Dataset](https://github.com/Mckinsey666/Anime-Face-Dataset), which consists of over 63,000 cropped anime face images. This dataset serves as the real data distribution for training the GAN model.

## Key Components

### Discriminator Network

The discriminator network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes an image as input and tries to classify it as "real" (picked from the original dataset) or "generated" (produced by the generator). It uses a binary cross-entropy loss function to quantify its ability to differentiate between real and fake images.

### Generator Network

The generator network takes a random latent vector as input and generates a synthetic anime face image. It employs transposed convolutions (deconvolutions) to upsample the latent vector and produce an image tensor. The generator's objective is to generate fake images that can fool the discriminator into classifying them as real.

### Adversarial Training

The training process involves alternating between the following steps:

1. **Train the Discriminator**: The discriminator network is trained on a batch of real anime face images from the dataset and a batch of fake images generated by the current state of the generator. The goal is to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss, improving the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake images.

2. **Train the Generator**: The generator network is trained using the discriminator's output as part of the loss function. The generator aims to generate fake images that can fool the discriminator into classifying them as real. This step involves minimizing the generator's loss, which is based on the discriminator's output for the generated fake images.

This adversarial training process continues for multiple epochs, with the generator and discriminator networks continuously adapting and improving their respective capabilities.

## Results

As the training progresses, the generator network becomes increasingly skilled at generating realistic-looking anime face images. The project includes visualizations of the generated fake images at different stages of training, showcasing the model's ability to capture the intricate details and characteristics of anime faces.

Additionally, the project provides plots of the generator and discriminator losses, as well as the real and fake scores, over the training iterations. These visualizations help monitor the training progress and ensure a balance between the generator and discriminator performance.
